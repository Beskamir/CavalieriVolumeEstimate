# Script for estimating volume from a set of cross section pictures of the object

## Purpose:

For a course that had me manually calculating the volume of the hippocampus using the Cavalieri method within ImageJ. This script allowed me to automate that provided I could give it segmented images where black (0,0,0) was the region I was interested in and anything else was ignored (for consistency I made the anything else be white). 

Literally only uploading this to GitHub since it seems like the least painful way of including this in my lab journal.
